# Outside of classroom project: Restaurant
After my military service I worked at a local bakery in the city.

Being a small local business, they used to manually document employee’s attendance reports and then forwarded them to an external accountant for the salary process.

This procedure frequently resulted in salary issues of inaccuracies and errors.

As a student in the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in the Computer Science faculty, now in my 4th semester, I realized that I could contribute and help the bakery solve this problem.

I developed a system for managing employees' working hours. Later, I realized that I could upgrade the system and added functionality that enabled full restaurant management: management of the working hours system, menu, customers, bookkeeping and statistics.

In writing the system I used many and varied data structures and different algorithms so that each function works efficiently and correctly.

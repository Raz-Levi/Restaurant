# Outside of classroom project: Restaurant
Following my military service, I worked at a local bakery in my city.

As a small local business, they used to manually document employee’s attendance reports and then forwarded them to an external accountant for the salary process.

This procedure frequently resulted in salary issues of inaccuracies and errors.

As a student in the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in the Computer Science faculty, now in my 4th semester, I have realized that I have the capability to help the bakery in solving this problem.

At the beginning, I just built a system to monitor the employees' attending hours but then I started to extend it and I have upgraded the system to cover full functionality for the bakery / restaurant management. The upgraded system includeds: the menu prices and costing, customers, income and expenses bookkeeping and also performance statistics.

In writing the system I used many and varied data structures and different algorithms so that each function works efficiently and correctly.
